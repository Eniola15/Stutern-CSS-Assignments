            <p class="two"> This week i have learnt what <b>CSS</b> is, and i have also learnt how important it is. Prior to this time,
                i learnt how to use git for version control and also HTML which gives structure to web pages. <br>

                how web pages are displayed and presented, it helps to style it as desired.</i> CSS also helps with the adaptation 
               to different devices and screen sizes.</p>

            <!--<h2>Third Section</h2>-->
            <p class="three"> Here i will explain the difference between <b>paddings, margins and borders in CSS.</b> They are all <i>CSS Properties.</i> 
           A margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content.
            In order words the margin controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.
            The border is the layer of the CSS box model that sits between margin and padding. <i>Margin and padding are always parts of an element, even if there's no visible border.</i>

            The CSS box model dictates how items are displayed within your project. It defines the boundaries, spacing in and outside of the target element.
            
            In a CSS box model, the height and width are specified.This determines the size of the content area. If the padding, border and margin proprties are also specified, <br>
                then they must be added to the <b>width and height to calculate the total size of the element.</b></p>
